       " 'For example , you ’ ve created a layer in Photoshop to give your image an antiqued look , but when you put it in your layout it seems swamped by the surrounding colors . One option might be to reduce the opacity of that layer by clicking on it and entering a new opacity level .\\n',\n",
       " 'If you want to add an extra ink or plate to your images , you can set up a channel to do that in Photoshop . For example , maybe you intend to varnish part of an image , or you want to use a spot color within your image .\\n',\n",
